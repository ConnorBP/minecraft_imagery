# Skript integration
This plugin includes a Skript integration.
This enables you to call the ImageCapture API via Skript.
There are some prerequisites to using the Skript integration:
- Skript should be installed (tested on v2.6.4)
- A storage provider should be configured

When you have done these things,
you can start writing scripts using ImageCapture.
